Module 11 Lab Exercise: Creating a Geologic Timeline to Scale
Mary Feezell

The height of the chart, 100,000 pixels or approximately 84 printed pages, was the minimum height to provide for legibility of time events in the current, Quaternary, Period.
Events occurred at marks or at the beginning of a period. Labels are elevated slightly above the dots marking the event for legibility.
Events indicating the start of geologic periods were omitted as these are indicated by boundary lines.
